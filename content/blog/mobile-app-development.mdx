# Mobile App Development: React Native vs. Native Development

Choosing between React Native and native development is one of the most important decisions when starting a mobile app project. Having worked on projects like Amplinks that require both approaches, I've gained valuable insights into when each approach shines.

## React Native: The Cross-Platform Champion

React Native offers compelling advantages for many projects:

### Advantages
- **Code reuse**: Share business logic between iOS and Android
- **Faster development**: Single codebase means faster feature delivery
- **Web development skills**: Leverage existing React knowledge
- **Cost effective**: Reduced development time and resources

### When React Native Works Best
- Apps with standard UI components
- Business applications and productivity tools
- Rapid prototyping and MVP development
- Teams with strong React experience

## Native Development: Maximum Performance

Native development still has its place in the mobile ecosystem:

### iOS with Swift
- **Performance**: Direct access to platform APIs
- **Platform integration**: Deep system-level features
- **User experience**: Platform-specific design patterns
- **Latest features**: Day-one access to new iOS capabilities

### When to Go Native
- Apps requiring intensive graphics or animations
- Applications needing deep platform integration
- Performance-critical applications
- Apps using cutting-edge platform features

## My Approach with Amplinks

For Amplinks, I'm using a hybrid approach:
- React Native for the main application logic
- Native modules for music downloading and file system access
- Web application using React for broader accessibility

## Making the Right Choice

The decision ultimately depends on your specific requirements, team expertise, and project constraints. Both approaches can deliver excellent results when used appropriately.

Consider your project's unique needs, and don't be afraid to use a hybrid approach when it makes sense.
